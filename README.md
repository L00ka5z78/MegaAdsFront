# Hey there!
Here is a project of app where you can add advertisements and display them on the map.
Basic features implemented. Like map, adding ads, displaying one add.

# This is project in progress.
### I will upgrade it soon. Will write rest CRUD operations add probably login -register - logout feature with JWT auth.


It was built during MegaK bootcamp, when I learnt Typescript and advanced Node features..
So it is not my own work. In general, in this state I added just few links to make moving in the app smoother.
 I will upgrade it, when I will find time, because I think, this project will be awesome after adding some functionalities.
But it is, as it is.

### Tech stack:
ExpressJs, Typescript, MySql database No frontend. Instead of this one use Express Handlebars to simulate it.

### To run the project:
Clone the  frontend repository: git clone https://github.com/L00ka5z78/MegaAdsFront
and clone the backend: git clone https://github.com/L00ka5z78/MegaAdsBack

### Install required dependencies.
Start the frontend and start the backend 
Scripts in package.json file
